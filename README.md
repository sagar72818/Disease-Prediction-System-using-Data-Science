# Disease-Prediction-System-using-Data-Science
Disease Prediction from symptoms using ML algorithms and Neural network.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Dataset_disease :=
   It contains the dataset which I have used. We have taken it from kaggle :-
   https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

2. Disease_prediction.ipynb :-
   In this file, I have done almost all major part including data preprocessing/data cleaning, data analysis and almost all ML models are executed on the dataset to get the 
   accuracies of each model and which performs the best.
   SVM with accuracy of above 99% is performing best, so we have used it to deploy it in the Deploy_GUI.ipynb file to get the better interface for the prediciton using PYTHON GUI.

3. Disease_prediction_nn.ipynb :-
   In this file, I have used the Neural network part using Deep learning to see the validation accuracy and training accuracy using neurons. It was also performing pretty good 
   for our model.

4. Deploy_GUI.ipynb :-
   In this file, I have done the deployment part using PYTHON's GUI and tkinter library to visualize the model efficiently.

5. Presentation1.ppt :-
   I have also included the ppt file which I have used for the presentation in my college for this project. You can also refer to this for more understanding of the overall 
   project idea.
